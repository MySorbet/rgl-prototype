# React Grid Layout Prototype

This is a bare bones implementation of a 2 breakpoint discreet grid implementation for sorbet profiles. Goal here was to isolate all RGL tricks and hacks so that we could take this into the sorbet app and integrate it with the more complicated use case of a profile. Also using vite to get a super fast dev loop.

## Dev

```sh
npm i
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build
```
